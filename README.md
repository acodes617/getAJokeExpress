Project: Get a joke and keep it if you like it!!

The objective of this mini project was to use express and node in order to send data to a server and have it stored there for later reference/use! I decided to 
use another api that would give me back random jokes and the user could decide whether or not they wanted to keep that joke in their server to use when they wanted to impress their friends! 

Feel free to use this code however you would like but also make sure that when you download this project that you install node, npm, express, and mongoDB if you haven't done so already! This will give you access to my database on mongoDB so that you too can have the best jokes in town right in your browser! Enjoy!!
